# LoanServiceDB_SQL

This is a school project that helps me to get familiar with ERD designed and SQL querys. 
We used `SQL Developer` to create a database for a imaginary loan business.
The project contains three parts as following.
- `Team MOCHI+ Project Report.pdf`: This pdf contains all the details about the project.
- `Loan_System.sql`: This file creates the basic sturcture for the database.
- `Loan_Query.sql`: This file is used for filitering the data for data exploration.

Although this project can use some improvement, I believe it would still help the beginners to understand how the SQL works. 
Please don't hesitate to ask questions and enjoy SQL! :+1:
